        <a><h3>I am studying a double degree in Business and Data Analytics and Computer Engineering as it combines technical and strategic skills. This way I will be prepared to make decisions and develop innovative solutions, excelling in both fields and contributing to technological and business advancement.</h3></a>
        <a><h3>This double degree lasts for five years and a half. During these years I will acquire knowledge in various areas like web design, mathematics, Bigdata, machine learning or business strategies. Moreover, it's combined with a Harvard methodology called college. 
            This program consists on an innovative system that gives students a general understanding of law, business management, economy, history, politics and competences and skills for personal growth.</h3></a>

            <li>Business basics: I learn how a business can impact a socitey and their structure, functions and development.</li>
            <li>Engineer mathematics 1: I will take this course next year. However I will learn the basic concepts of algebra.</li>
            <li>Marketing and Sales strategys: I will learn different methods to perform sales and reach people.</li>
            <li>Software engineering: I will learn how to develop an efficient and well-organised software.</li>
