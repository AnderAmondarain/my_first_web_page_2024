        <a><h1>Fundamentals of computer engineering</h1></a>
        
        <a><h3>The course Fundamentals of Computer Engineering offers a global vision of computer engineering in theory and practice. It addresses its mathematical, physical, anthropological, ethical, professional opportunities...</h3></a>
        <a><h3>The course is divided into two parts:</h3></a>
        <a><h3><ul>
            <li>A theoretical one, which includes three blocks: computer engineering in societ, its history, evolution and ethics; representation and organization of information; and, fundamentals, current paradigms and technological trends.</li>
            <li>A practical part, which focuses on the development of skills such as autonomous and team work, communication, compromise with peers, etc. This part includes a group presentation both oral and written on a topic, as well as a web and software development work.</li>
        </ul></h3></a>
        <a><h3>This course aims to know the purpose and social impact of computer engineering, to know its evolution, to explore professional opportunities, to give importance to the human being in new technologies and to have knowledge about technological trends, data management, software and web development.</h3></a>
        <a><h3>Fundamentals of computer engineering not only seeks to develop students in the theoretical, but also in the practical and real. Making an integral formation of the engineer.</h3></a>
