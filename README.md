## Description
-More of Ander is a website in which you can find information about: me, Ander, academic and personal; the blockchain application to the voting system;and, the double degree I'm studying and the Fundamentals of computer engineering course. Moreover, you can see webs of other people, and, you can contact me!

## Problems
-I had lot of different problems during the software development of the website. I didn't know a lot about the topic, so I spend a lot of time searching commands in google or seeing videos about html and css. I had a special issue with the position of the images, texts, footer... with the position of the content in general. I solve this problem by trying different command, failing, and, learning about what happened. My second biggest problem was the correct use of the commands; during the creation process, problems appeared that I have solved but I think that not in the most efficient and organized way.

## Conclusion
-Building "More of Ander" was both tough and satisfying. Altough I faced some problems during the development of the website, like content position or struggles with HTML and CSS, the project made me learn a lot through the autonomous experimentation and problem-solving. More of Ander includes 6 different sections which show interesting information and images. This project made me improve my web development skills and establish the bases for future works and improvements.
