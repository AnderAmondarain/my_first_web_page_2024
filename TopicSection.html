        <a><h1>Electronic voting system using Blockchain</h1></a>
        
        <a><h3>Online voting faces challenges like distrust, lack of infrastructure or cybersecurity risks. Blockchain technology could solve these problems, giving electronic processes more transparency and security.</h3></a>
        <a><h3>Electronic voting via blockchain consists of a system in which votes are registered in a blockchain. Each vote is a unique transaction. But, how it works?</h3></a>
        <a><h3><ul>
            <li>People that want to vote are registered in a digital identity system.</li>
            <li>People vote via a voting application. Each vote is sent to a blockchain system as a unique transaction.</li>
            <li>All the votes are organised in a blockchain.</li>
            <li>Blockchain technology ensures that votes can be counted instantly and precisely, without intermediaries.</li>
        </ul></h3></a>
        <a><h3>Although blockchain technology in the electoral process has lots of advantages such as security, transparency, efficiency or accessibility, it has diferents limitations and challenges like the technological access, the legal limitations or voters privacy.</h3></a>
        <a><h3>Various countries have started to use blockchain. The first one was Sierra Leone in 2018. This country used blockchain to register the electoral resulsts of a specific region during the presidential elections. Other countries are Estonia or Switzerland.</h3></a>
